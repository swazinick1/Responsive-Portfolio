                        Hello! My name is Nicholas Xavier Stovall, born in Dallas, TX February 20th, 1990. I have moved
                        around the metroplex over the years and know many ins and outs of this great city. Although I
                        have been here for many years there is still a lot to be discovered especially with our
                        cultural diversity. For example, many great places to eat that you would never think of until
                        you meet people that have migrated here. Sharing time with others has allowed me to open my
                        tastes in cultural foods. The jobs I have done have allowed me to explore deep into the cities
                        business's. Fire and security technician for Dedmon security let me travel in the great triangle
                        from Fort Worth to Waco to Forney with Dallas being the heart of it. Nine years residential and
                        commercial landscape has given me great opportunity to explore also... 121, that median, who do
                        you think planted all those trees and shrubs.. atleast played part. I really enjoy residential
                        landscape installs like flower beds/gardens and stone patios. I have experienced much more in
                        that field in nine years but that is the fun part. Another fun job I enjoyed was
                        barback/bartending. Its been about four years now and the people I have met have been a great
                        networking experience, yet there are some who are not so great lol. I take craft to my cocktails
                        and provide quality in my recipies which has allowed me to expand to private events. Perhaps
                        one day it will be a side gig just like landscaping.

                        I've learned a lot from others over the years, and went to college with a focus on
                        biotechnology. One day it occuered to me as I was watching this bee fly around that I needed to
                        learn those skills. Although I dont apply them at the moment, it was a great experience in the
                        lab learning how to clone cells and bacteria. Creating modified bacteria to carry genes of
                        interest that would later be used to infect a host to change its genetic make up but those are
                        old techniques.A great example would be inserting the luciferase gene from the lightning bug
                        into a bactrium called agrobacterium tumafaciens which causes crown gall disease in plants, but
                        instead of it infecting the host plant with the disease it inserts our gene of interest. The
                        goal is to make plants auto luminesce on there own but we are not there yet. What we have to do
                        at the moment is water it with water/luciferen ratio in order to get it to glow.
